// This program is written in the C++ language.

// Input: The program will read the 
// the first line of an input file may contain 25 10,
// where 25 indicates number of students and 10 is the number of scores for all students.
// 
// After that, name of student followed by scores from a text file

// Ex. SPWKLZWHCIE GAPCEXAS  99 100 91 68 72 100 93 74 77 96
// Where,
// SPWKLZWHCIE GAPCEXAS is the studentâ€™s name and
// 99 100 91 68 72 100 93 74 77 96 are the exam scores.
// 
// A 2-D (25* 10)array will store the scores of all students and 
// 1-D array will store the name of students
// Another 1-D array will store the average score according to the exam 
// 
// Then, the grade was counted according to diffrence of the average score and student's score
// 
// Output: The program will generate the text file having the date of student's name, and a grade equivalent to the average score with it's grade
